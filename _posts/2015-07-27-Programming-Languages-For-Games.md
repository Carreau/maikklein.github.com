Disclaimer:
This posts is very opinionated and it documents my search for the 'perfect' programming language.


I have programmed in a many different languages which gave me a good overview of what is out there. Unfortuneatly it also ...


Some Features that I expect:

Algebraic Data Types: ADT's are absoultely awesome, it is hard to go back to a langage that doesn't have Optional/Maybe.

Pattern matching: Keeps you sane if you have to do many if checks, works especially nice with ADT's

Higher kinded types: Sometimes it is nice to abstract over types.

Generics + Generic constrains: 

Static/Dynamic dispatch

Traits/Type classes/External interfaces

Variadics

Safe Macros

Multicore support

Tooling

Static Typing

Low level control when needed

Good ecosystem of libraries

Stable

Metaprogramming

Reflection: It would be nice if external tools could easily extract information about your code.

Big community
